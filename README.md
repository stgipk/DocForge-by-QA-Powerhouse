# DocForge-by-QA-Powerhouse
Inhouse tool developed by Pratik to ease in document upload and fraud testing

With the recent enhancements as a part of fraud framework we introduced document check to make sure that no fraud document goes unnoticed by SBA folks.

Now for testing purpose we faced few issues like:
- Uploading a fresh document everytime to move the application ahead.
- Finding duplicate document/blank document/fillable pdf everytime for negative testing by Risk review team or the QA team in general to generate risk review.
- Now there are few random doc generators present on the internet but they have some issues.
  - Not trusted
  - Contains ads and maybe malwares too, we cannot risk that.
  - Download does not happen in a second, usually takes some time
  - requires active internet
    
  We tried to solve all these issues and created the webiste. The setup just takes 2-3 minutes and runs without any internet and runs with one click.
